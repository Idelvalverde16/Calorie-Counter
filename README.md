# Calorie-Counter
Learning form validation by building a Calorie Counter.

Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to accept input from a user. In this calorie counter project, I learned how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update the interface to display the results.

In this practice project, I learned basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more. Practicing in https://www.freecodecamp.org.
